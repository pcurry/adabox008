Note: This is the CircuitPython Hello World that contains code for playing audio.
I have not included the WAV file in the repo because (1) I try not to put 
binary artifacts into repos and (2) because I don't own the rights.

The Adafruit `hello.wav` I used can be found linked in the Hello World walkthrough
in the Adafruit Learning System, which is also the origin of the first iteration of
this `hello_world.py`.
